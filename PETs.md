## Privacy Enhancing Technologies

### Definition

Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are a set of technologies and methods that allow the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of insights while protecting the confidentiality of data (often personal).

### State of Play

PETs are not necessarily new, but advances in computing power and infrastructure have led to new possibilities in their use for data processing and sharing.
Many of these developments are still novel or emerging. Namely, policy makers, regulatory bodies and authorities are starting to consider how to incorporate PETs in their data protection by default and by design processes.

### Categories

PETs can be divided into four categories (OECD):
* **Data obfuscation tools**: tools that increase levels of privacy protection by changing the data, by adding "noise" or by suppressing disclosive information:
  
    * Types: e.g. anonymisation and pseudonymisation tools; synthetic data; differential privacy, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP);
    * Advantages:
    * Cautions: needs correct implementation; data not necessarily anonymous since some tools or added data may be able to reidentify 

* **Encrypted data processing tools**: tools that allow data to remain encrypted during use.

    * Types: e.g. homomorphic encryption; multi-party computation; trusted research environments / secure data environments
    * Advantages: data does not need to be decrypted before use
    * Cautions: computation and infrastructure costs, ...

* **Federated and distributed analytics**: tools or procedures that allow analytical actions to be run on data, but where the data is not visible or accessible while executing those actions.

    * Types: e.g. federated learning protocols
    * Advantages: microdata does not need to be shared by parties to allow for insights; scalability
    * Cautions: computation and infrastructure costs, connectivity, ...
 
* **Data accountability tools**: tools that seek to enhance data protection and privacy by allowing for data subjects to have control over their own data. Not strictly a PET since their primary aim is not data confidentiality itself but rather control and accountability. 

    * Types: e.g. personal data stores, accountable systems
    * Advantages: user control and transparency
    * Cautions: low maturity and technology readiness of tools; narrow scope use cases; few standalone applications
